warning: Maximum frequency rate (3500 Hz) exceeded, throttling from 4999 Hz to 3500 Hz.
         The limit can be raised via /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_sample_rate.
         The kernel will lower it when perf's interrupts take too long.
         Use --strict-freq to disable this throttling, refusing to record.
